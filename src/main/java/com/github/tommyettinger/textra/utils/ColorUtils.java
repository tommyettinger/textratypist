    /**
     * Parses a color description and returns the approximate color it describes, as an RGBA8888 int color.
     * Color descriptions consist of one or more alphabetical words, separated by non-alphanumeric characters (typically
     * spaces and/or hyphens, though the underscore is treated as a letter). Any word that is the name of a color in
     * {@link Palette} will be looked up in {@link Palette#NAMED} and tracked; if there is more than one of these color
     * names, the colors will be mixed using {@link #unevenMix(int[], int, int)}, or if there is just one color name,
     * then the corresponding color will be used. A number can be present after a color name (separated by any
     * non-alphanumeric character(s) other than the underscore); if so, it acts as a positive weight for that color
     * when mixed with other named colors. The recommended separator between a color name and its weight is the space
     * {@code ' '}, but other punctuation like {@code ':'}, or whitespace, is usually valid. Note that in some contexts,
     * color descriptions shouldn't contain square brackets, curly braces, or the chars <code>@%?^=.</code> , because
     * they can have unintended effects on the behavior of markup. You can also repeat a color name to increase its
     * weight, as in "red red blue".
     * <br>
     * The special adjectives "light" and "dark" change the lightness of the described color; likewise, "rich" and
     * "dull" change the saturation (how different the color is from grayscale). All of these adjectives can have "-er"
     * or "-est" appended to make their effect twice or three times as strong. Technically, the chars appended to an
     * adjective don't matter, only their count, so "lightaa" is the same as "lighter" and "richcat" is the same as
     * "richest". There's an unofficial fourth level as well, used when any 4 characters are appended to an adjective
     * (as in "darkmost"); it has four times the effect of the original adjective. There are also the adjectives
     * "bright" (equivalent to "light rich"), "pale" ("light dull"), "deep" ("dark rich"), and "weak" ("dark dull").
     * These can be amplified like the other four, except that "pale" goes to "paler", "palest", and then to
     * "palemax" or (its equivalent) "palemost", where only the word length is checked.
     * <br>
     * Note that while adjectives are case-insensitive, color names are not. Because the colors defined in libGDX
     * {@link Colors} use ALL_CAPS, and the colors additionally defined by {@link Palette} use lower case and are always
     * one word, there are a few places where two different colors are defined by names that only differ in case.
     * Examples include {@link Palette#orange} and {@link Palette#ORANGE}, or {@link Palette#salmon} and
     * {@link Palette#SALMON}.
     * <br>
     * If part of a color name or adjective is invalid, it is not considered; if the description is empty or fully
     * invalid, this returns the RGBA8888 int value {@code 256} (used as a placeholder by
     * {@link com.github.tommyettinger.textra.ColorLookup}).
     * <br>
     * Examples of valid descriptions include "blue", "dark green", "DULLER RED", "peach pink", "indigo purple mauve",
     * "lightest, richer apricot-olive", "BRIGHT GOLD", "palest cyan blue", "Deep fern black", "weakmost celery",
     * "LIGHTMOST rich MAROON 2 indigo 3", "red:3 orange", and "dark deep (blue 7) (cyan 3)".
